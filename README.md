<h1><b>Academic Project - Analysis of Hydrogen Peroxide as a Disinfectant</h1></b>
This real-life academic project aimed to analyze the influence of Hydrogen Peroxide as a disinfectant. The project involved collecting data through a survey conducted via Google Forms. The collected data underwent rigorous preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency. Subsequently, Power BI was utilized for further data transformation and in-depth analysis.

The primary objective of this project was to investigate the level of awareness and perception among respondents regarding Hydrogen Peroxide as a disinfectant. The analysis sought to identify trends, preferences, and potential areas for improvement in disinfectant usage.

Upon analyzing the data, a significant finding emergedâ€”more than half of the respondents were not aware of Hydrogen Peroxide as a disinfectant. This insight highlights the need for greater awareness and education about the benefits and applications of Hydrogen Peroxide in disinfection. It presents an opportunity to disseminate relevant information to the general public, health professionals, and other stakeholders, emphasizing the effectiveness of Hydrogen Peroxide as a disinfectant.

Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the majority of respondents preferred chlorine as their first choice for a disinfectant. This finding indicates the prevailing perception and popularity of chlorine among the surveyed population. It also provides an opportunity to educate individuals about the advantages and potential drawbacks of different disinfectant options, encouraging informed decision-making in hygiene practices.

By leveraging Power BI for data transformation and analysis, this academic project effectively visualized the survey results, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the influence of Hydrogen Peroxide as a disinfectant. The visualizations generated in Power BI aid in identifying key patterns, trends, and preferences among respondents, enabling researchers and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and implement strategies to promote awareness, knowledge, and optimal disinfection practices.

In conclusion, this academic project successfully analyzed the influence of Hydrogen Peroxide as a disinfectant using data collected through a Google Forms survey. The project highlighted the need for increased awareness about Hydrogen Peroxide among respondents and shed light on the prevailing preference for chlorine as a disinfectant. The insights gained from this project can inform educational campaigns, research initiatives, and public health strategies aimed at promoting effective disinfection practices and expanding the understanding of alternative disinfectants.
